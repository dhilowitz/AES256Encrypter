AES256Encrypter
===============

A Command-Line AES256 Encryption Utility for Mac

This tool is especially useful when you want to encrypt somewhat sensitive application data (plists, for example) on-the-fly as part of XCode build process so that they can be decoded by your application. One possible use for this is making iOS or OSX game data more tamper proof.
